            <h2>Not My Country but My Music</h2>
            <p>
               First of all, I would like to solemnly pledge my allegiance to afrobeats and fuji. They got me through these past 1.5 decades, they've been there when i needed them, they saw me through my thick and thin so YEAH! afrobeats and fuji baby for life.

               Country music is what i want to discuss a little about. this genre of music originated from the southeastern part of america(yeah i know rightðŸ™„, so far from ibadan but thank God for the internet). Its music made with simple lyrics, funny antics and often interesting story telling. This type of music is exclusively made by americans and a massive cultural movement since its inception into the music creative art.

               Often times the lyrics from this songs are about beer, truck, country-side girls and farms/ranches, guns and falling in love, basically a day-to-day life of a cowboy. As simple as this seems, the entire genre has managed to have perfect a way to talk about this things in such an endearing and passionate way so much so that its like a soothing massage to the heart. I am a huge fan of this genre and listening to it is part of my daily routine.

               With the coming of newer generations and younger artists like morgan wallen, luke combs, lainey wilson, the genre itself seems to be undergoing a form of evolution which i personally appreciate.

               I understand this section of the assignment instructs us to share a powerful message about oneself which is why i decided to take this approach. Firstly, like most young folks of my generation music is a big part of my identity and my music tastes has helped me explore and understand quiet alot  about different cultures that are currently far from my physical reach.It also has helped me better understand human nature alot more. Lastly, Through music, sounds and words significant messages are conveyed to whosoever seems interested to understand and interpret. 
            </p>


            <h1>Message of an art can be a cry for help or the blissfull expression of freedom. It is there for all to take in!</h1>
